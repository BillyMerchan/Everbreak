# Ever Break

*RCOS Project - Co-operative fantasy ARPG*

## Overview

Ever Break is a cooperative fantasy action role playing game that has soulslike combat.
This game was thought up as a response to my experience playing multiplayer games with soulslike combat and mmorpgs with lackluster combat.
Both of these genres seemed to miss the mark on what I was looking for in an interactive battler where you took on larger than life bosses with friends.
The end goal is to create a foundation for a game with regions, loot, and enemies upon which I can iterate on as I want to add new content.
Players should have the ability to customize their characters with unique armor/weapons/incantations found through exploring the world and beating monsters.
Players should also have the ability to team up with friends in one large world and take on raid bosses with seamless connection to game servers.
